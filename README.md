Tool to generate dataset for fuzzing evaluation.
The tool for paper <A Feature-Oriented Corpus for Understanding, Evaluating and Improving Fuzz Testing>,
which is pulished on AsiaCCS2019.

The code here for generating data is the old version. 
We're trying to rewrite the new version.

The fuzzing data in the directory ./experiments is the corpus we use in the paper.
