Tool to generate dataset for fuzzing evaluation.
The tool for paper <A Feature-Oriented Corpus for Understanding, Evaluating and Improving Fuzz Testing>,
which is pulished on AsiaCCS2019.

The code here for generating data is the old version. 
We'are trying to rewrite the new version.

The fuzzing data in the directory data is the corpus we use in the paper.
